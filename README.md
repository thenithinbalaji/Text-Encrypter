# Type of Encryption
This program uses symmetric ASCII encryption technique and file format encryption technique to encrypt the user data.

# Languge 
This app was made completely in c++ because of the versatile and light nature of c++. The appropriate standard libraries were used in this app.

# Usage
After running the code, the user gets a prompt to choose   
Press 1 for Encrypting     
Press 2 for Decrypting      
Press 3 for Exiting the App      
When the Encryption option is chosen, the user is asked to enter the filename. After the file is chosen, the app uses its in-built algorithm to encrypt the file and stores it in filename.en format. The filename.en is completely unreadable by any software except this file encryptor app. 
While Decrypting, the filename.en file is chosen and the data inside it is decrypted back to machine-readable format. 
 
# Supported File Formats
filename.txt    
filename.en

# Why is Encryption Important? 
In this digital era, information is often challenging to protect. Privacy has certainly become a myth these days. So, the data is often encrypted to prevent leaks and unwanted access to them. The encryption is done by using complex algorithms to encrypt the file and properly protecting the KEY to decrypt the file back to a readable format.
